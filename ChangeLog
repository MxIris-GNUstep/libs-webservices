	For ease of use, allow soap header values to be placed in the params
	directly rather than in a dictionary referenced by
        GWSSOAPMessageheadersKey

2008-12-12 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	Add more soap argument setup and verification code.

2008-12-11 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	Simplify extensions handling by combining validation and service setup
	as there is a whole lot of common code.
	Add example of encoding with header information.
	Remove GWSCoderHeaderUseKey and GWSCoderBodyUseKey and replace both
	with GWSCoderUseKey to avoid confusion.

2008-12-08 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	* GWSSOAPCoder.m: Add support for namespace name and prefix in header.

2008-11-30 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	Add more features to GWSElement for namespace management.
	Change delegate encoding/decoding methods to provide better context.

2008-11-18 Richard Frith-Macdonald  <rfm@gnu.org>

	Loads of tweaks/improvements to have a GWSService object setup
	itsself and its coder to perform an operation based on the information
	parsed from a WSDL document.  The idea is to avoid the programmer
	having to setup the options and the URL to port to etc.

        * WebServer.m: On receipt of an unparsable request, send a 400
	response.
