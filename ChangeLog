	Add more features to GWSElement for namespace management.
	Change delegate encoding/decoding methods to provide better context.

	Loads of tweaks/improvements to have a GWSService object setup
	itsself and its coder to perform an operation based on the information
	parsed from a WSDL document.  The idea is to avoid the programmer
	having to setup the options and the URL to port to etc.
