Completely implement parsing of a WSDL document into a GWSDocument
and related objects (this is pretty close now).

Add binding support so we can do the whole SOAP thing automatically
over http, https etc (done, but needs more testing etc).

Implement generation of a WSDL document from a GWSDocument (actually, this works but could do with improving).

Implement parsing of schema documents for SOAP type definitions (critical).

Apply SOAP type definition information derived from WSDL/schemas to
encoding/decoding SOAP messages in the 'literal' style.

Add support for more of the basic xsi:... types.

Examples

Implement a gui application to open/parse a WSDL document and display its
contents in an easy to understand manner with forms allowing you to select
a service/method, enter parameters and make a call to the service, and see
the results of that call.

Implement a gui application (better would be to add a plugin to Gorm) to
allow graphical creation of a service definition (ie create methods and
define the arguments and result of the method etc).  This should then allow
a WSDL document describing the service to be renerated, and stub code for
the server/clint to be produced.

Add support for encryption and signing of requests.
