        <heading>What are the WebServices classes?</heading>
        <p>
          The WebServer library contains a collection of classes to be used
          for creating client and server 'web service' applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GWSService class is used to make RPCs as a client.
          This class makes use of GWSCoder classes to serialize
          the request before sending it to the remote system,
          and to deserialize the response received.<br />
          Different GWSCoder sublasses handle different encoding mechanisms,
          and this library provides one for XMLRPC (because it's a nice,
          simple mechanism good for most normal applicatiions), and one for
          SOAP (because, while it's a horrible, bloated, designed-by-comittee
          mechanism, it's also the most common one by far and the standard
          one for web services).
